        Mekhi's love for CS/IT started at a young age when he received his first computer. Since then, he has been tinkering with software, hardware, and programming languages. His curiosity and eagerness to learn have led him to attend various tech events, workshops, and seminars. He believes that technology can be used as a tool for social change and is determined to use his skills to make a positive impact in his community. Mekhi's love for cycling also fuels his creativity, as he often uses his time on the bike to brainstorm new ideas and problem-solve.
